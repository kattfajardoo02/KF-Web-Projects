<h3 style="background-color: #6B8E23;"> <I>Ingredients: </I> </h3>
&#8226 1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter, softened <br/>
&#8226 1/2 cup (102 g) vegetable shortening, softened <br/>
&#8226 1/2 cup (60 g) confectionersâ€™ sugar, sifted <br/>
&#8226 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract <br/>
&#8226 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom <br/>
&#8226 1/4 teaspoon salt <br/>
&#8226 2 1/2 cups (325 g) all-purpose flour 
<hr/>
<h3 style="background-color: #6B8E23;"> <I>Instructions: </I> </h3>
1. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer, cream the butter and shortening together on medium speed for 1-2 minutes. <br/><br/>
2. Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, cardamom, and salt. Beat on medium-low speed just until combined. <br/><br/>
3. Add the flour and beat on the lowest speed just until no visible streaks of flour remain. <br/><br/>
4. Shape the dough into a ball and flatten into a disk. Wrap the disk tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30-60 minutes, until the dough is firm enough to roll out. <br/><br/>
5. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat. <br/><br/>
6. Lightly flour the work surface and roll the dough to a little less than 1/2-inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut desired shapes <br/><br/>
7. Place the cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. <br/><br/>
8. Bake 1 sheet at a time for 8-10 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges and center is just set. <br/><br/>
9. Cool cookies on the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

&#8226 <q> The dough crumbled as a rolled it out so I let it rest for about 10 min then it rolled out nicely. 30 min chill would have been perfect rolling temperature. Thank you for the recipe. </q><cite> Anita Rojas </cite> <br/>
&#8226 <q> These cookies are quite good. They're a dry cookie, best to be eaten with coffee or tea. I love the flavor of cardamom, so these are lovely. </q><cite> Valentina Smith </cite>
